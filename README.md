# Swift

Swift is Facebook's version of the Apache Thrift project

http://thrift.apache.org/

The previous java code now lives in a subdirectory at lib/java.  The rest of this repository will contain Facebook's other thrift languages.


# Merging with Apache Thrift

Facebook lacks sufficient manpower to merge many of the changes back to the apache thrift project, but we'd still like to make our code available if someone else would like to merge it.
